# wifi-v-distance-strength-testing
 Publishing data from testing Wi-Fi vs distance signal strength testing


## Why?

For years, I looked online for relational graphing of how Wi-Fi signal strength deteriated over distance.
I was aware of [Free Space Path Loss](https://www.everythingrf.com/rf-calculators/free-space-path-loss-calculator) formula stating that it should be logarithmic, but I still had questions.

- How far from an access point can I connect to a 2.4 GHz access point? How does 5 GHz compare?
- How do I compare which signal will be stronger? for how far?
- How fast can these bands handle at different ranges?

I could never find anything besides "theoretical maximum"...
